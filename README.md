# K-means-clustering
## Topic for Session 7: “Unsupervised Machine Learning”
(Cesar Montiel-Olea and Ana Yarygina)
In this session, you will be introduced to another type of machine learning algorithm: unsupervised machine learning methods. Unlike supervised machine learning, in unsupervised machine learning the goal is to find the structure in the data without knowing the correct solution. We will put particular emphasis on the K-means clustering algorithm, one of the most popular techniques in unsupervised machine learning.  We will use the kmeans R function to fit clustering models. You will also be introduced to text clustering using the topics function from maptpx R package.
